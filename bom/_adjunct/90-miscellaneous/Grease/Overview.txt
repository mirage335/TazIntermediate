V-Slot Linear Bearing surfaces, V-Wheel Ball Bearings (spread on top before assembly), and Z-axis grease points must only use Super Lube 41150 Synthetic Grease grease.

NEMA17 motor ball bearings may or may not benefit from grease. Do not attempt to use silicone based grease - the higher friction displacing any factory oil may cause more harm than benefit.

Only belts must only use silicone based PTFE grease, due to chemical compatibility with neoprene. Severe wear to belt and pulleys will result without this specific grease..
