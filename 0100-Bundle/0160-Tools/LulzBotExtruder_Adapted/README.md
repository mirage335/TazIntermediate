'Stock' is expected to be workable as-is, though rigidity might be a little less due to use of plastic. This may or may not be significant.

'Bare' strictly considered experimental due to imprecise cooling mounting dimensions due to lack of matching accurate blower fan model for reference. Also for this reason the 'LulzBotExtruder_Block' has not been exported to other formats (ie. STEP, STL).
