To be noted on a document attached to machine under waterproof enclosure.

MOTORS MUST HOLD WHILE CHANGING TOOL/FILAMENT OR Z-AXIS WILL BE BACKDRIVEN OUT OF ALIGNMENT!

Purple marked objects are intended for frequent user interaction, such as quickchange mount points.

Metalized tape shims are to be used to adjust Z-axis limit switch, and possibly also to adjust slab corner heights.

BAUDRATE		250000

microSteps/mm X/Y	114.29 or 114.79 (thermoplastic shrink compensation)
microsteps/mm Z		400

Motor current 1.7A or less if downgraded.
	Marlin/RAMBO firmware 255 'DIGIPOT_MOTOR_CURRENT' setting.
