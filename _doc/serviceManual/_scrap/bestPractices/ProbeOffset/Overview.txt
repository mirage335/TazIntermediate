Set the XYZ distance from the nozzle to the probe trigger-point.

    The easiest way to get the Z offset value is to:
    Home the Z axis.
    Raise Z and deploy the probe.
    Move Z down slowly until the probe triggers.
    Take the current Z value and negate it. (5.2 => -5.2)
    Set with M851 Z-5.2 and #define Z_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER -5.2.

For X and Y you have to measure the distance.
