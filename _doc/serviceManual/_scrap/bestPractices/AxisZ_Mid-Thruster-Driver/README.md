# Driver

## Preload

Lead screw (ACME Threaded Rod) *must* be pulled away from the motor by at least 2.5mm, under tension provided by flexible coupling, as the lock collar is tightened.

Preload is *required* to ensure accurate motion and prevent independent vibration.

If this step is necessary and omitted, theoretically, among other problems...
* Slab leveling may need to be performed frequently.
* Top surfaces of printed parts may appear to have incorrectly tall regions (warping without detaching from the slab).
* Visible surfaces on printed parts may appear rougher at long regions near the edges due to independent mechanical 'ringing'.


# Thruster

## Optional.

May be omitted entirely.

Intended to prevent the lead screw (ACME Threaded Rod) from moving freely along the X-axis, Y-axis, or downwards along the Z-axis.

May not be necessary. Wheels, being far more rigidly constrained than legacy bushings, should prevent lead screw from moving freely along the X-axis or Y-axis. Adequate driver preload should prevent lead screw from moving freely downwards along the Z-axis.

If this part is necessary and omitted, theoretically, among other problems...
* Misalignment of one printed layer from the next may occur. Such misalignment would manifest as a 'wavy' side-to-side appearance of a printed part from top to bottom.

## Optional.

May be omitted partially. Lock collar and all shims, including the metal and flexible shim, may be omitted.

Intended to prevent the lead screw (ACME Threaded Rod) from moving freely downwards along the Z-axis.

May not be necessary. Adequate driver preload should prevent lead screw from moving freely downwards along the Z-axis.

If this part is necessary and omitted, theoretically, among other problems...
* Slab leveling may need to be performed frequently.
* Visible surfaces on printed parts may appear unusually rough/ragged.


## Preload

Lock collar must be tightened at least 0.5mm further down the lead screw (ACME Threaded Rod) than required to meet the following metal shim. Otherwise, the lock washer and subsequent shims serve no purpose.

* Slab leveling may need to be performed frequently.
* Visible surfaces on printed parts may appear unusually rough/ragged.
