Idler Plate must be cut to smaller size - 'Threaded Rod Plate Nema 17-Idler' .

ACME threaded rods must be carefully sanded to exactly fit ball bearings. Ideally, this should be done in stages from rough to fine grit sand paper.

Excessive sanding will result in a loose fit between the bearing and threaded rod, leading to a variety of severe mechanical problems severely reducing print quality.

Cutting of threaded rods to length should be done after any diameter reduction by sanding, to allow for mistakes to be corrected.
