GantryPlate-Taz
XYplate
	* Ensures machine is assembled orthogonally - intended to provide flat surfaces and correct spacings.
	* Resists deformation more strongly than separate corner brackets - all three rotation axes constrained by large plates.
	* Flatness and hole spacing tight tolerance. Outline loose tolerance.

ShimFlexiblePreload-8mm
	* May reduce bearing failure rate - intended to spread load from possibly misaligned lock collar.
	* Omit if ambient temperature is to exceed 60C (ie. if within higher-temperature enclosure).
	* Loose tolerance. Surface defects tolerable. Less than solid infill preferred. High compressibility desired. Ideally 3D printed from transparent highly flexible material, possibly TPU or TPC.
	* May be substituted by neoprene foam.
